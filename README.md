# Prolog Lab Practice – GTU Semester 7 👨‍💻📚

This repository contains screenshots and practice materials related to **Prolog commands** executed during **Lab Sessions of the Artificial Intelligence subject** in **Semester 7 (GTU Academic Curriculum)**.

## 📁 Contents

I have uploaded screenshots of various Prolog list operations which I practiced during my lab sessions. The following commands are covered :-

### ✅ Practiced Prolog Commands:
- `concat/3` – Concatenates two lists
- `delete/3` – Deletes an element from a list
- `length/2` – Finds the length of a list
- `member/2` – Checks membership of an element in a list
- `reverse/2` – Reverses a list
- Basic **list operations** and predicates

## 🖼️ Uploaded Files

Screenshots are named and organized based on the command or function being demonstrated:
- `concat_command_ss.png`
- `delete_command_ss.png`
- `length_command_ss.png`
- `member_command_ss.png`
- `reverse_command_ss.png`
- `list_operations_overview_ss.png`

> These images reflect live Prolog terminal practice during the lab session.

## 🎯 Objective

To understand and implement **basic list operations in Prolog** as part of AI subject practicals, improving logic-building and syntax knowledge in declarative programming.

## 📌 Note

- These screenshots are for **educational and documentation purposes only**.
- All commands were practiced using a **Prolog compiler/interpreter** during academic lab hours.
